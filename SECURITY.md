## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy & Confidentiality

This platform handles sensitive information that requires special protection:

#### Student Learning Data
- **Personal Information**: Student profiles contain learning history and performance metrics
- **Privacy Requirements**: All student data must be treated as confidential
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Data Retention**: Follow institutional policies for data retention and deletion
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/FERPA compliance where applicable

#### Educational Content
- **Copyright Protection**: PDF materials may be subject to copyright
- **Licensing**: Verify rights to use and distribute all educational content
- **Institutional Content**: Medical curriculum materials may be proprietary
- **Third-Party Content**: Respect licensing terms of external resources

### Security Best Practices

When contributing to or deploying this platform:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files or credentials to version control
   - Use secrets management tools for production
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Authentication**
   - Use strong password requirements
   - Implement secure session management
   - Enable multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

3. **API Security**
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies

4. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
   - Restrict database access to authorized services only

5. **File Uploads**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Store files securely with restricted access
   - Implement virus scanning for PDF uploads

6. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Monitor for known vulnerabilities (Dependabot enabled)
   - Review security advisories regularly

7. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Do NOT log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PHI)
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Implement alerting for security events

## Sensitive Data Guidelines

### What NOT to Include in Repository

- ❌ Student personal information (names, IDs, emails)
- ❌ Authentication credentials or API keys
- ❌ Database connection strings with passwords
- ❌ Proprietary educational content without permission
- ❌ Copyrighted PDF materials
- ❌ Production configuration files
- ❌ Private encryption keys

### What to Protect in Deployments

- 🔒 Student learning profiles and mastery data
- 🔒 Quiz questions and answers (to prevent cheating)
- 🔒 PDF source materials (copyright considerations)
- 🔒 User authentication tokens
- 🔒 Database backups containing user data
- 🔒 Application logs containing PHI/PII

## Legal Compliance

### Educational Content Licensing

**TODO**: Before production deployment, ensure:

1. **Copyright Clearance**: All PDF materials have proper usage rights
2. **Attribution**: Properly attribute content sources
3. **Licensing**: Document licensing terms for all content
4. **Institutional Agreements**: Obtain necessary permissions from medical schools or content providers
5. **Fair Use**: Ensure usage complies with fair use provisions where applicable

### Data Protection Regulations

Consider compliance with:
- **GDPR** (EU): If serving European students
- **FERPA** (USA): If handling US student educational records
- **HIPAA** (USA): If content includes patient information
- **Local Regulations**: Consult with legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific requirements

## Incident Response

In case of a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify compromised data
   - Assess impact

3. **Notification**
   - Inform affected users (if applicable)
   - Report to relevant authorities (as required by law)
   - Communicate with stakeholders

4. **Remediation**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
