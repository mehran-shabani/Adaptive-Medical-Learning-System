## Initial Setup

After setting up the database for the first time:

1. Create initial migration:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial tables"
```

2. Apply migration:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on development database first
- Keep migrations small and focused
- Never edit applied migrations; create new ones instead
